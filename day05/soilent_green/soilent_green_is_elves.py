# The almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be planted. 
# It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what type of fertilizer 
# to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use with each kind of fertilizer, 
# and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer and so on is identified with a number, 
# but numbers are reused by each category - that is, soil 123 and fertilizer 123 aren't 
# necessarily related to each other.

# The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted

# The rest of the almanac contains a list of maps which describe how to convert numbers 
# from a source category into numbers in a destination category. 
# seed-to-soil map: describes how to convert a seed number (the source) to a soil number (the destination). 
#       This lets the gardener and his team know which soil to use with which seeds, which water to use with which fertilizer, and so on.
# 
# Each line within a map contains three numbers: 
#        the destination range start, 
#        the source range start, 
#        and the range length.

# Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number.
#  So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10.

# The gardener and his team want to get started as soon as possible, 
# so they'd like to know the closest location that needs a seed. Using these maps, 
# find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seeds.
